### README for Fraud Detection Project

#### Overview
This project is focused on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of various transaction details, which are preprocessed, modeled, and analyzed for fairness and interpretability.

#### Files Included
- **Fraud_detection.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **sample_transaction_data.csv**: The dataset used for training and evaluation.

#### Preprocessing
- **Drop Irrelevant Columns**: Columns like `transaction_id`, `transaction_date`, and `account_open_date` are removed.
- **Handle Non-Numeric Values**: Non-numeric characters in numeric columns are removed and converted to numeric types.
- **Fill Missing Values**: NaN values in numeric columns are filled with the mean, and in non-numeric columns with the mode.

#### Model Training
- **Random Forest Classifier**: A Random Forest model is trained on the preprocessed dataset.
- **Train/Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

#### Fairness Evaluation
- **Fairlearn Integration**: The fairness of the model is evaluated using Fairlearn's `MetricFrame`, focusing on demographic parity difference.

#### Model Interpretability
- **SHAP**: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to explain the model's predictions globally and locally.
- **LIME**: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) is used to interpret individual predictions and provide insight into the model's behavior.

#### Visualization
- **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the performance of the model on the test set.

#### Usage Instructions
1. **Run the Notebook**: Open the `Fraud_detection.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment and run the cells sequentially.
2. **Dataset**: Ensure `sample_transaction_data.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
3. **Dependencies**: Install necessary Python packages like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `shap`, `lime`, and `fairlearn` if they are not already installed.

#### Future Work
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Explore different hyperparameters for better model accuracy.
- **Advanced Fairness Metrics**: Incorporate additional fairness metrics to evaluate the model comprehensively.
- **Deploy Model**: Consider deploying the model using a cloud service like Azure or AWS.
